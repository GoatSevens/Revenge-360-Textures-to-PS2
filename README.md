> * Set "Load Textures" to "On" under the "Texture Replacement" tab.
> * Set "Mipmapping" to "Off" under the "Rendering" tab.
> * Set "Anisotropic Filtering" to "16x" under the "Rendering" tab to reduce noise.
>
> Recomendation:
> * For best visuals, set "Blending Accuracy" to "High" under the "Rendering" tab for accurate reflections (may impact performance)

> [!NOTE]
> * There are very few textures that are not present in the 360 version. These missing textures are left as is or have been replaced with a modified texture.
> * Some textures have been altered or modified to prevent weird mappings on the object, e.g., diagonal stripes in the tunnels of White Mountain.
> * Vehicle props (like the barrels, boxes, and sacks) have been 360-fied although some are missed due to the (observed) rarity of these props appearing.
> * 99% of the textures in each track has been covered. There could still be some textures missed but are not noticable under normal gameplay.
